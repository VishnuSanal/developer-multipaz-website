# Getting Started

Multipaz is an identity framework designed to handle secure, real-world credential issuance and
verification. This guide helps developers to quickly get familiar with the APIs by walking you
through the end-to-end identity flow -- from issuing a digital ID to verifying it across devices.

The guide follows the **Credential Lifecycle** â€“ and the guidance to implement each of the steps
using Multipaz.
